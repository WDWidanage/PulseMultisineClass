# Pulse Multisine Class - To estiamte non-linear equivalent circuit models of lithium-ion batteries


## Intro
This class allows a user to deifne a pulse-multisine signal (as an alternative to the commonly used HPPC - Hybrid Pulse Power Characterisation test) which can be used to develop non-linear equivalent circuit models of lithium-ion batteries



A Matlab class to generate pulse-multisine signals and estimate non-linear equivalent circuit models of li-ion batteries
